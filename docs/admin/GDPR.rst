GDPR
====

The GDPR provides the user with different rights regarding their data and ILMo tries to help you fulfill these requirements.
For this application there are different scenarios that are applicable.

Transparency and Modality
-------------------------

The user must be informed in a "in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form,
using clear and plain language". This is currently up to you, to provide an imprint with such information.

Information and Access
----------------------

Article 15 gives the user the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being
processed, specifically the purpose of the processing (Article 15(1)(a)), with whom the data is shared
(Article 15(1)(c)), and how it acquired the data (Article 15(1)(g)).

For ILMO this could be a short description::

   ILMO processes your data to keep track of loans (e.g. to let staff know what you borrowed and remind you to return it),
   give you access to resources such as rooms and fulfil other tasks of library management.
   Your data is not given to third parties. Your data was provided by you or added by staff/automatically as part of an
   action by you (e.g. borrowing a book).
   It is also possible that there is data of you accessing resources of this program to prevent malicious activity.

The right to access the data can easily fulfilled with ILMO, a user can always request a copy of their data in their profile.

Rectification and erasure
-------------------------
Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds within 30 days.
This is currently not implemented by he software and has to be done by staff manually as a user should not be allowed to
delete all information without returning loans.
