Lending
================================

You can check the available books or material online with your account.

To borrow any books or material you have to visit the library and search for the item you want to borrow.

An administrator will then check the label of the item. The item will then be marked as borrowed by you (visible only for librarians.

You have to return the item according to the rules of the library. If you don't, there will be a reminder.
