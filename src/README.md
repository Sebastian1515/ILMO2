# Acknowledgment

Thanks to the amazing Django community that provides a awsom documentation and to the [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/django-locallibrary-tutorial) that provided a very similar project where I got many ideas and quite some code from. CC-0 is an amazing license, thanks for using it.
